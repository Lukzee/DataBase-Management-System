 Purple Haze Hotel Reservation System
 
 A hotel reservation management system  maintains a record of the guest. A guest should book room/rooms in advance and should also be able to make use of the facilities provided by the hotel. A record of the services availed by the guest should be kept as well. These records help in generating the final bill.
Our system provides the automation of reservation, facilities and billing system to the front desk staff and allows the guests to make and cancel bookings via the website.
